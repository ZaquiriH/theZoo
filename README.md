# theZoo
A small c++ program with JNI for bookkeeping a zoo.

I really enjoyed the challenge of writing this CPP. I think I effectively implemented polymorphism using unique_ptr and object casting, though I don't know enough about smart pointers to know if my implmentation was actaully good or if my code is actaully a monstrosity. I think I probably could have moved a few structs and functions to a seperate file to give this code more moularity, but one of my weaknesses is having lots of aditioanl files, so I tend to curb my tendency to make extra files, probably to my detriment. I definitely used a lot of stackoverflow to solve some of the problems in this. In particular, I had the hardest time trying to extract member variables from a 3rd gen child inside a base class vector containing smart pointers. I think the time crunch of this project made it that much more fun to work on, and having to manage my time right to make sure this got done is a skill I can use across any part of my career. A lot of this code is self explanatory with minimal comments, and uses newer features of C++ such as smart pointers, but I plan to improve the struture and such in the future, since this would be rather useful to show off to a future employer.
